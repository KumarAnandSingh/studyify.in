      <p>Interest in blockchain technology has exploded by more than 550%【34209624818819†L97-L118】. Beyond the hype of cryptocurrencies, banks are experimenting with distributed ledgers to improve settlements, cross‑border payments and foreign exchange trading.</p>
      <p>Major institutions like HSBC and Wells Fargo have used blockchain platforms to settle forex trades, reducing costs and settlement times【34209624818819†L97-L118】. By eliminating intermediaries and creating immutable transaction records, blockchain can enhance transparency and security.</p>
      <p>However, adoption remains in early stages. Technical standards, regulatory clarity and interoperability will determine how quickly blockchain moves from pilot projects to mainstream finance.</p>

    excerpt: 'An internal USAID analysis challenges Israeli claims that Hamas diverted humanitarian aid in Gaza. Here’s what the report found and why it matters.',
    content: `
      <p>A confidential USAID analysis reviewed 156 incidents related to aid distribution in Gaza and found <strong>no evidence</strong> that Hamas systematically stole or diverted humanitarian supplies【931615986133505†L162-L181】. In fact, 44 of the incidents were linked to Israeli military actions rather than theft【931615986133505†L162-L181】.</p>
      <p>The report contradicts long‑standing accusations that Hamas benefits from U.S.‑funded aid, suggesting that oversight mechanisms are working. A U.S. State Department spokesperson disputed the findings, citing ongoing investigations【931615986133505†L162-L181】.</p>
      <p>The controversy highlights the challenges of delivering aid in conflict zones and the political pressures surrounding humanitarian efforts. Transparent reporting and independent audits will be critical to maintaining donor confidence.</p>

      <p>In a landmark agreement, India has agreed to gradually cut tariffs on imported British vehicles from more than 100% today to about 10% over 15 years【915007923225866†L155-L196】. The move signals a new openness to foreign trade even as India protects sensitive sectors like agriculture and dairy【915007923225866†L195-L218】.</p>
      <p>British manufacturers gain better access to India’s huge market, while Indian exporters hope to sell more textiles, jewellery and pharmaceuticals in the UK【915007923225866†L155-L196】. This deal is described as one of India’s most important trade partnerships, reflecting its strategy to balance global integration with domestic interests.</p>
      <p>Despite tariff concessions, negotiations preserved key “red lines”—meaning that dairy and agricultural tariffs remain high【915007923225866†L195-L218】. The outcome demonstrates the complexity of modern trade agreements and the art of compromise.</p>
